# Tetris
Made for fun with the intent for learning practical C++ & library/include file integration with Cmake  

# Build Instructions
1. Enter the build file through terminal
2. Make a empty folder & go into it
3. paste below & hit enter
```shell
cmake ../.. && make && ./tetrisrlcpp
```
Thats it! if you know what you're doing just build it on your own whatever way, I'm using Cmake anyway.
